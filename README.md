# Eternal AI

## Overview

Eternal AI provides an innovative solution by offering immediate, preliminary assessments of skin conditions through AI-driven analysis. Users can upload an image and provide symptom data, receiving real-time feedback on potential skin conditions. This not only expedites the process of identifying skin issues but also educates users on skin health, guiding them on when and how to seek professional care. Our solution is tailored for scenarios where dermatological appointments might be inaccessible, delayed, or where patients are unwilling to make physical appointments.
